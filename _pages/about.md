I am Yixin Ren (任一鑫), a fourth year PhD student at Fudan University.
I belong to Prof. [Shuigeng Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yAE-Av4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) 's group. I received my B.S. degree in Automation from the University of Science and Technology of China. In the second year of my PhD, I interned at Alibaba in Hangzhou. In the third year of my Ph.D., I went to the Chinese University of Hong Kong as a research assistant, cosupervised by Yufei Tao. Now, I mainly collaborate with Dr. [Hao Zhang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~hzhang10) at Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT) for research. I am open to possible collaboration or discussion opportunities. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me via [email](yxren21@m.fudan.edu.cn). 

**Research interests**

* Causal discovery under the practical issues
* Statistical inference: kernel-based hypothesis testing
* Machine learning: focus on continual learning, recommendation system and generative modeling

## Miscs

* In my recent free time, I have become interested in learning about general relativity. 

  *My childhood dream was to become a theoretical physicist, but forced by reality it is now only a hobby.*

* Like all things abstract: Picasso paintings, the simple and elegant math structure, etc.

* Love to sing, better at Jacky Cheung and Eason Chan, but lately I like Jian Li the most and am practicing light mixing.
