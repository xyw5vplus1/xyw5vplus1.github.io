I am Yewei Xia (夏业伟), a first-year PhD student at Fudan University.
I belong to Prof. [Shuigeng Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yAE-Av4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)'s group.
I received my bachelor's degree from Communication University of China. During my study, I have spent time at Tencent, Alibaba DAMO Academy.

I am open to possible cooperation or visiting opportunities. 
Further, I am always happy to collaborate with junior (undergraduate / master) students.
Students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to reach out!
If you are interested, feel free to contact me by [email](ywxia21@m.fudan.edu.cn).
 

**Research interests**
* Causal discovery (especially in heterogeneous environments), causal representation learning, disentangled representation learning. 
* Probabilistic methods: inference, generative models, uncertainty modeling.
* Self-supervised learning and its support theory.

## Miscs
* I enjoy sporting and watching sports games, especially soccer and badminton. I am interested in analyzing soccer formation and tactics. Feel free to communicate with me.
* I enjoy playing sudoku, minesweeper and other mind games (including problems in algorithm contests >_<). 
* In my spare time I like to read history books, especially Chinese history.
